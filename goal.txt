NEXT SECTION: ARTISTS ANALYSIS
Hereby, we completed our initial analysis about audio features themselves and some other success metrics. In the following section, we will dive into world of artists and achieve a more in-depth analysis on these:
a) what contributes to the popularity of any artist,
b) do the success metrics depend on audio features,
c) how the success rates seem over the course of time,
d) can the genres or styles of artists be predicted using all metrics,
e) is it possible to make recommendation for wannabe-popular artists, and lastly,
f) is it possible to recommend artists to spotify users using assocation techniques
and in order to achieve all these, we will apply many regression, classification and clustering methods, and even develop associative-based recommendation system
